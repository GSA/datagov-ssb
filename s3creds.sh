# If you want to use a cloud.gov-brokered S3 broker for your Terraform state,
# this script makes it easy both to create a service key and to extract the
# bucket parameters needed for the Terraform backend configuration.
#
# If your S3 service instance has a different name, or you want a different key
# name, edit the following two lines.
# 
# NOTE: This script has been tested with CF CLI v8!
